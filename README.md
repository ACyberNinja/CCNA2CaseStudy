This was the case study that I did for my Cisco 2 class. 
I had to do some configuration on this small network using the Cisco simulation software packet tracer.
This network incorporates VLANS, Etherchannel, DHCP and Port Security. 
There was a limitation with packet tracer where the Etherchannel was missing a certain command and this caused a problem with the DHCP.
